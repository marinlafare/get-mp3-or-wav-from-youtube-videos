# Get audio from youtube videos WAV or MP3


Extract audio from youtube video in mp3 or wav format.
Requires [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) and [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube).

You'll need to create two folders: audios_from_yt and videos_from_yt in the same folder as main.py

Then just run main.py and provide a URL in the console.

Audio file will be at "audios_from_yt" folder.

The Notebook test_app.ipynb is useful to test the pipeline.
